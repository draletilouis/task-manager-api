# Kazi - Full Stack Task Management Application

A modern, collaborative task management system built with React and Node.js. Features workspaces, projects, tasks with Kanban boards, and team collaboration. [In development]

**Monorepo Architecture** | **JWT Authentication** | **PostgreSQL Database** | **96.5% Test Coverage** | **Modern UI/UX**

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment files (see Database Setup section below)
# Create apps/api/.env with your DATABASE_URL

# Initialize database
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate

# Start both frontend and backend
npm run dev
```

**API**: http://localhost:5000
**Web**: http://localhost:5173

### Database Setup

You'll need a PostgreSQL database. Choose one of these options:

**Option 1: Cloud PostgreSQL (Recommended)**
- **Supabase** (Free tier: 500MB): [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
- **Neon** (Free tier: 0.5GB): [neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
- **Railway** ($5/month credit): [railway.app](https://railway.app)

**Option 2: Local PostgreSQL**
- Install PostgreSQL locally
- Create database: `createdb task_manager`

Then create `apps/api/.env`:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:5432/database_name"
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production"
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET="your-super-secret-refresh-token-key-change-this-in-production"
PORT=5000
```
